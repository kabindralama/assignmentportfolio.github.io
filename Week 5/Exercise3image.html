        <p bgcolor = "white">Web design refers to the design of websites 
        that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of 
        website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on 
        designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile 
        and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p>
