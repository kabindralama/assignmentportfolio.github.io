            software, quantum computing, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and consumer electronics. It has been referred to as the "most powerful company 
            in the world" and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the area 
            of artificial intelligence. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and 
            Microsoft. Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California.

            went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is 
            Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google 
            on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.
